        <p>Hello! My name is Michael Pytlowany and I enjoy making things with many different mediums.</p>
        <h2 id="myStart">How I got my start</h2>
        <p>I first became interested in coding when I got my 3d printer. I was in the process of adding a
            series of upgrades. In order to get the printer where I wanted it to be, I had to crack open the
            firmware and customize it. A lot of questions and a few sleepless nights later and I am still using that
            same
            complied firmware. That was 2 years ago.</p>
        <p> Since my first encounter with code, I had been thinking of the differnt options for breaking into the field.
            While asking around, my wife's friend mentioned she had attented a program at Grand Circus and had nothing
            but
            good things
            to say about it. Not just about the learning experience but the benefits from having atteneded here. It
            takes me
            a bit to finalize my big life decisions
            but am very confident in this new journey.
        </p>
